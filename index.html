                          <p>
                            In ancient Greek mythology, the gods and goddesses ruled from the heights of Mount Olympus, overseeing the lives of mortals with their immense power and often unpredictable whims. At the head of this divine pantheon stood Zeus, the king of the gods, wielder of thunderbolts, and enforcer of justice—though not always faithful to his wife, Hera, the fiercely protective goddess of marriage. Together with their siblings and children, they shaped the world, controlled the elements, and meddled in human affairs, leaving behind legendary tales of love, war, and vengeance.</p>

                            <h4>The Cradle of Civilization</h4>
                            <p>
                                Ancient Mesopotamia, located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, is often called the "Cradle of Civilization." It was home to some of the earliest cities, writing systems, and legal codes in human history. Civilizations like the Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians thrived here, building complex societies with advanced agriculture, trade, and governance. From the Epic of Gilgamesh to Hammurabi’s Code, Mesopotamia laid the foundation for much of human progress and continues to influence modern culture and law.
